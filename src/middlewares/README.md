# 🤖 Defines routes are protected by authenticated users

**A middleware is a function that sits between two other functions**, 🤝Intercepting the data that flows between them.

🛡️ In web development, middlewares are often used to **modify** incoming requests or outgoing responses, or to **perform some other kind of processing** on the **data**.

> _For example, in an `Express.js` web application, a middleware might be used to **log incoming requests** 📝, or to **authenticate users before allowing them to access** certain routes 🔒._

Middlewares can also be used to **modify the response data**, such as by _adding headers_ 📨 or _transforming the data_ in some way 🔄.

Overall, middlewares are a powerful tool for developers to add functionality to their applications in a **modular and reusable way.**

By breaking down complex functionality into smaller, composable pieces, developers can create more **maintainable and scalable applications**. 🚀
