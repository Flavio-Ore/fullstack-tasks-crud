## TL;DR

A library (or "lib" for short) is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform common tasks or add functionality to an application. 🛠️

Libraries are typically distributed as packages that can be installed using a package manager, such as npm. Once installed, the library can be imported into an application and used to perform specific tasks or add functionality to the application. 📦

There are many libraries available for JavaScript, ranging from general-purpose libraries like Lodash and jQuery to more specialized libraries for tasks like data visualization or server-side rendering. By using libraries, developers can save time and effort by leveraging pre-written code and focusing on the unique aspects of their application. 💻
