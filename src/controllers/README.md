# 🎮 Functions that will be used when a URL is visited

Create functions that will be used by the routes to handle the requests and responses to the frontend.

> _When the url's visited, the controller functions will be called._

## TL;DR

A controller is a function that is **responsible for handling requests and responses** between the frontend and backend. 🕸️

Controllers are typically **used in conjunction with routes**, which define the URLs that the frontend can use to interact with the backend.

When a client makes a request to a particular URL, the corresponding **controller function is called to handle the request and generate a response**.📡

Controller functions can perform a wide range of tasks, such as _retrieving data from a database, processing user input, and generating `HTML` or `JSON` responses_.

By encapsulating these tasks in separate controller functions, developers can create more **modular and maintainable code**. 🧩
