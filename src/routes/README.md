# 🛣️ Create the urls of the backend

- Create endpoints or routes that will be used by the frontend
- The urls are the same as the frontend, but with a /api/ prefix

Example: `/api/users` is the url for the users endpoint.

A **route refers to a URL endpoint that is used to handle incoming requests from clients**, such as web browsers or mobile apps. 📡

Routes are defined by the backend application and **specify the actions that should be taken when a client** makes a request to a particular URL.

> _For example, a route might be defined to handle requests to the `/api/users` URL, which would be responsible for retrieving or modifying user data in the backend database. 📈_

## Routes are typically defined using a framework or library

**Such as `Express.js` in JavaScript**

> _Can be configured to **handle different types of HTTP requests**, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 🚀_

URLs that are the same as the frontend but with a `/api/` prefix. This is a **common convention** in web development, where the frontend and backend are separated into different applications or services, and the `/api/` prefix is used to distinguish between URLs that are handled by the backend API and those that are handled by the frontend application. 🤝
